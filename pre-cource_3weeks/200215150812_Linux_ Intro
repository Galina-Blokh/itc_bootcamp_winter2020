1. Extract the files from the compressed archive file (hint: use tar). Delete the archive file
when done.
gal@ubuntu:~$ cd Downloads
gal@ubuntu:~/Downloads$ ls
'200207123327_Ex 13 - csv json and pkl.py'   hw_25000.csv       mlb_players.pkl
 comments.csv                                hw_25000.json      OS_Terminal
 comments.json                               mlb_players.csv
 cpp_headers.tar.gz                          mlb_players.json
gal@ubuntu:~/Downloads$ mkdir cpp_he
gal@ubuntu:~/Downloads$ tar -xf cpp_headers.tar.gz -C cpp_he
gal@ubuntu:~/Downloads$ cd cpp_he

2. What is the biggest file in the current directory?
gal@ubuntu:~/Downloads/cpp_headers$ ls -lSh | head -n 5
total 1.1M
-rw-r--r-- 1 gal gal  80K Jan 26  2016 functional
-rw-r--r-- 1 gal gal  66K Jan 26  2016 limits
-rw-r--r-- 1 gal gal  58K Jan 26  2016 type_traits
-rw-r--r-- 1 gal gal  52K Jan 26  2016 complex



a. How big is it?
gal@ubuntu:~/Downloads/cpp_headers$ ls -sh functional
80K functional


b. What are the last 5 lines of that file when you sort it alphabetically? (hint: use sort
and tail)
gal@ubuntu:~/Downloads/cpp_headers$  sort functional | tail
  // when casting between void pointers and pointers-to-pointers.
  // when first argument has integer type, so that std::bind() will
  // when the first argument might be a socket file descriptor.
   *  will have a weak result type. See cases below.
       *  wrapper.
       *  __x (if it has one).
	  __x._M_manager(_M_functor, __x._M_functor, __clone_functor);
	__x.swap(*this);
    { __x.swap(__y); }
// You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License and

c. Print the first row of the file to the screen
gal@ubuntu:~/Downloads/cpp_headers$ head -n3 functional
// <functional> -*- C++ -*-

// Copyright (C) 2001-2013 Free Software Foundation, Inc.


d. What are the current file permissions? Print it. What does it mean?
gal@ubuntu:~/Downloads/cpp_headers$ ls -l  functional
-rw-r--r-- 1 gal gal 81127 Jan 26  2016 functional
owner can read and write, groups and others can only read

e. Change the permissions of the file so that everyone can write, read and execute
it.
gal@ubuntu:~/Downloads/cpp_headers$ chmod 777 functional
gal@ubuntu:~/Downloads/cpp_headers$ ls -l  functional
-rwxrwxrwx 1 gal gal 81127 Jan 26  2016 functional
