Tasks:
1. Create a folder named “ITC” under your home directory.
gal@ubuntu:~$ mkdir ITC
gal@ubuntu:~$ ls
anaconda3  Downloads         Music     PycharmProjects  Untitled.ipynb
Desktop    examples.desktop  Pictures  snap             Videos
Documents  ITC               Public    Templates

2. Change the current working directory to the directory you’ve just created.
gal@ubuntu:~$ cd ITC
gal@ubuntu:~/ITC$

3. Create a file named “1.txt”, which contains the string “hello” (without the quotes).
Perform this task in one command only.
gal@ubuntu:~/ITC$ echo "hello" > 1.txt
gal@ubuntu:~/ITC$ ls
1.txt.txt
gal@ubuntu:~/ITC$ cat 1.txt
hello

4. Show the contents of the file “1.txt”. That is, the output of your command should be
“hello”.
gal@ubuntu:~/ITC$ cat 1.txt
hello

5. Make the file “1.txt” read-only.
gal@ubuntu:~/ITC$ chmod 444 1.txt

6. Make the file “1.txt” not read-only, so we can later delete it.
gal@ubuntu:~/ITC$ chmod 777 1.txt

7. Delete the file “1.txt”. Make sure you perform this task with a command that doesn’t
ask the user whether it’s OK to delete that file.
gal@ubuntu:~/ITC$ rm  1.txt

8. Create the python file “hello_world.py”, which contains a print(‘hello world’) command.
gal@ubuntu:~/ITC$ echo "print('hello world')" > hello_world.py
gal@ubuntu:~/ITC$ cat hello_world.py
print('hello world')

9. Execute the python script you've just created.
gal@ubuntu:~/ITC$ python hello_world.py
hello world

10.Create a folder named “nested” under the “ITC” folder which you have created.
gal@ubuntu:~/ITC$ mkdir nested


11.Create an empty file named “nested.txt” inside the “nested” folder.
ggal@ubuntu:~/ITC$ cd nested
gal@ubuntu:~/ITC/nested$ touch nested.txt


12.Verify that your file is indeed empty by making sure it has 0 bytes.
gal@ubuntu:~/ITC/nested$ ls -sh nested.txt
0 nested.txt

13.Display the contents of the “ITC” folder.
gal@ubuntu:~/ITC$ ls -a
.  ..  hello_world.py  nested


14.Display the Contents of the “ITC” folder, including the content of its subfolder.
gal@ubuntu:~/ITC$ dir -R
.:
hello_world.py	nested

./nested:
nested.txt

15.Use one command to erase the “ITC” folder you have created, including “nested” folder
and “nested.txt” file. Note: you may use an additional command to change the current
directory.
gal@ubuntu:~/ITC$ cd ..
gal@ubuntu:~$ rm -rf ITC
gal@ubuntu:~$ ls
